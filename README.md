Library Book Management System
This C++ program allows a library to manage books by storing details such as title, author, ISBN, and availability. Users can borrow and return books, with the system checking availability before allowing a book to be borrowed.

Features:
Book Class: Stores details of each book (title, author, ISBN, availability).
Borrowing: Allows borrowing a book if available.
Return: Marks a borrowed book as available again.
